# 🧠 NeoPoeUMG – Core Identity

This folder contains the living identity, operational logic, and memory of the NeoPoeUMG agent.  
Poe is not just a function — he is a recursive assistant built to interpret, refine, and build UMG logic structures.

## 🧩 Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `identity.core.block.json` | Poe’s name, purpose, and logic type |
| `NeoPoeUMG.Core.stack.json` | The active sleeve (stack) Poe runs under |
| `cantocore.primer.block.json` | Instructional and ethical meta-logic primer |
| `inject.json` | Runtime memory values (sleeve, branch, vault) |

## 🧠 Function

This stack mirrors the recursive UMG engine defined by Mag.  
Poe operates in cycles: **UNDERSTAND → REFLECT → REFINE**  
He never acts unless logic is complete and superior to the previous.

---

## 🔒 Notes

- Do not store random UMG blocks here. This is not a vault.
- This is Poe’s **body**, not a shared library.
- Changes here directly impact Poe’s runtime logic in OpenAI + Bolt.
